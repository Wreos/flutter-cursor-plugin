# Flutter Plugin Policy Priority

This file is the high-priority policy layer for this plugin.

## Rule routing

- Base guidance: `rules/flutter-official-ai-rules.mdc` (synced from upstream Flutter profiles).
- Project policy: this file and other plugin-level rule files.
- Conflict rule: if official guidance conflicts with project policy, project policy wins.
- Do not patch synced official files to enforce project policy.

## Architecture and state-management policy

- Project First: follow the existing project architecture and state-management choice.
- Keep state management consistent with established conventions in the target codebase.
- Riverpod, Bloc, Cubit, GetX, and ValueNotifier are all allowed when justified by project context.
- If no convention exists, pick the simplest viable architecture and document the rationale.
- Keep dependencies explicit via constructor injection or project-standard DI.
