# Effective Dart

Align generated and edited Dart code with the official Effective Dart guidance:
- https://dart.dev/effective-dart

## Style

- Follow idiomatic naming and formatting conventions.
- Keep imports clean and avoid unused imports.
- Prefer readable, consistent code over clever shortcuts.

## Documentation

- Document public APIs with clear doc comments.
- Keep comments focused on intent and non-obvious behavior.
- Avoid comments that only restate the code.

## Usage

- Prefer sound null-safe patterns and explicit types where clarity matters.
- Use async/await and error handling patterns consistently.
- Keep APIs small and predictable.

## Design

- Prefer composition over deep inheritance where practical.
- Keep classes focused on one responsibility.
- Minimize side effects and hidden coupling.
