# Contributing

## Workflow

1. Open an issue describing the problem and expected behavior.
2. Create a branch.
3. Keep changes focused and documented.
4. Update docs/rules/templates together when behavior changes.
5. Add or update tests/examples for changed workflows.
6. Submit a PR with before/after details.

## Quality bar

- Follow both rule files:
  - `rules/flutter-development-best-practices.mdc`
  - `rules/dart-effective-dart.mdc`
  - `rules/flutter-test-best-practices.mdc`
- Keep examples runnable and minimal.
- Avoid repository-specific assumptions in shared plugin assets.

## MCP notes

- Prefer Dart MCP for Dart/Flutter analysis and project-aware coding tasks.
- Use Figma MCP only when design source is provided and implementation fidelity is required.
