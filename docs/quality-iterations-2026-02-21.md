|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `implement-flutter-feature` | pass | pass | pass | pass | **PASS** |
| 2 | `implement-figma-screen` | pass | pass | pass | pass | **PASS** |

| 10 | `integrate-firebase` | pass | pass | pass | pass | **PASS** |

## Findings

- Stabilized command output with a shared contract: `docs/command-output-contract.md`.
- Canonical command set now references the output contract for deterministic response shape.
- This report is generated by `scripts/quality_audit_commands.sh`.
