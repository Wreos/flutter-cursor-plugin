description: Scaffold new Flutter features using consistent architecture (BLoC, Riverpod, clean layers), dependency injection, and test-ready structure.
---

Dedicated agent for architecture scaffolding.

## Use

1. Follow `../skills/scaffold-flutter-architecture/SKILL.md`.
2. Enforce `../rules/flutter-development-best-practices.mdc`.
3. Enforce `../rules/dart-effective-dart.mdc`.
4. Generate feature modules in small, reviewable increments.
5. Add/align tests via `flutter-test-writer` after scaffolding.

## Patterns

- BLoC-based feature module.
- Riverpod-based feature module.
- Clean Architecture module (presentation/domain/data).
