- Added output expectations to all agents and standardized required output sections across all skills.
- Added validation script for agent/skill prompt quality:
  - `scripts/validate_agents_skills.sh`
- Verified prompt test matrix for all agents/skills (26 checks, all passing).
- Hardened command prompts with shared execution guardrails:
  - `docs/prompt-execution-guardrails.md`
- Added deterministic validation guidance:
  - `docs/validation-matrix.md`
- Updated canonical commands and core skills for:
  - explicit fail-fast behavior when required context is missing
  - tighter scope control and deterministic validation requirements
- Updated active official Flutter AI rule to choose state management by project conventions (Riverpod/Bloc/Cubit/GetX/ValueNotifier based on context).
- Added reference example repository for project structure and tests:
  - https://github.com/Wreos/flutter-cursor-plugin-example
- Added pre-release enable guide (`docs/pre-release-enable-plugin.md`) with repository install and manual workspace settings options.
- Added semantic prompt quality gates:
  - `scripts/validate_prompt_semantics.sh`
  - `.github/workflows/semantic-quality.yml`
  - `docs/semantic-quality-gates.md`
- Updated scaffold architecture guidance to prefer existing project state-management convention before selecting a pattern.
- Reworked official Flutter AI rules integration to use policy routing instead of post-sync text patching:
  - added high-priority policy layer `rules/flutter-plugin-policy-priority.mdc`
  - kept synced upstream profiles as base source of truth
- Added deterministic environment setup workflow:
  - command: `commands/setup-flutter-environment.md`
  - skill: `skills/setup-flutter-environment/SKILL.md`
- Simplified command prompts by removing repeated guardrails boilerplate from canonical command files.
- Strengthened semantic output quality across agents/skills:
  - explicit truthfulness policy (`planned/not executed` wording when no command evidence exists)
  - required missing-inputs/assumptions notes for partial context
  - required next steps and confidence/residual risk coverage in output contracts
- Added external backend API integration workflow:
  - command: `commands/integrate-mobile-api.md`
  - skill: `skills/integrate-mobile-api/SKILL.md`
- Removed `flutter:*` command aliases and kept canonical commands only.
- Breaking: removed `flutter:*` command aliases; use canonical command names only.
- Removed alias maintenance artifacts:
  - deleted `docs/command-namespacing.md`
  - deleted `scripts/generate_namespaced_command_aliases.py`
