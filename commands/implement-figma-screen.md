Implement a Flutter UI from Figma source.

1. Follow `../skills/build-flutter-features/figma-to-flutter.md`.
2. Enforce `../rules/flutter-development-best-practices.mdc`.
3. Enforce `../rules/dart-effective-dart.mdc`.
4. Use Figma MCP for node context, layout, spacing, typography, and assets.
5. Use Dart MCP for post-implementation analysis and fixes.
6. Add widget tests for critical interactions and visible states.
7. If no Figma URL/node is provided, stop and request it before implementation.

Preconditions and guardrails:
- Enforce `../docs/prompt-execution-guardrails.md` before execution.
- Validate outcomes using `../docs/validation-matrix.md`.
