Set up and validate Flutter environment before development work.

1. Follow `../skills/setup-flutter-environment/SKILL.md`.
2. Capture `flutter --version`, `dart --version`, and `flutter doctor -v`.
3. Verify Dart MCP availability with `dart mcp-server --help`.
4. Run repository baseline validations after setup changes.
